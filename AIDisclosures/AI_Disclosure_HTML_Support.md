## AI Assistance Disclosure
This project was developed with assistance from generative AI tools:
- **Tool**: ChatGPT 5.2 (By OpenAI)
- **Date(s)**: January 29th, 2026
- **Scope**: As I am new into working with HTML and CSS, I had some bugs that I didn't realize, despite completing courses on both languages. For example, when I was trying to embed a button on an image, I was unsure why the clickable area was beyond the image. Other examples include font and alignment issues with the text. 
- **Use**: When I had these kinds of bugs, I showed ChatGPT my code. Each time, it would examine my code and tell me what needed to be fix. While I didn't exactly copy the code it produced, I used it as a guidance for my bugs. I also used the explinations it gave me to learn from my mistakes and prevent a bug like this in the future. In the end, I was able to find the bugs in my code, despite it not always giving me a correct answer.

All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and modified to meet
assignment requirements. Final implementation reflects my understanding
of the concepts.
