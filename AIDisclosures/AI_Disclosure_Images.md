## AI Assistance Disclosure
This project was developed with assistance from generative AI tools:
- **Tool**: ChatGPT 5.2 (By OpenAI)
- **Date(s)**: January 29th, 2026
- **Scope**: While working on the frontend of our website, I wanted to have navigation between pages be buttons embedded within images. However, I was unable to find images that fit our office theme (I.E., there was no image on the internet that showed a copier with a transparent background, a notebook that says "signup", etc)
- **Use**: I asked ChatGPT to make images for the following pages:
   1. All the navigation buttons on our website.
   2. The background picture on the home page and sign up page.

Despite detailed prompts, it struggled at first to satisfy my requirements. Eventually, I got it to work, and I think it was a good solution to the problem.

All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and modified to meet
assignment requirements. Final implementation reflects my understanding
of the concepts.
