## AI Assistance Disclosure
This project was developed with assistance from generative AI tools:
- **Tool**: ChatGPT 5.2 (By OpenAI)
- **Date(s)**: February 16th, 2026 - February 18th, 2026
- **Scope**: I noticed that our website was having issues with the contact table going off screen and background zoom on mobile devices for their respective pages. Despite setting the normal mobile device support settings in our html hiles, we still had these issues.
- **Use**: I asked ChatGPT how I could easily fix the above issues without compromising the settings we set for the desktop versions of these pages. I was completely unaware that CSS supports specific settings for devices of a certain width or less. As such, ChatGPT showed and provided me with the very small code that would fix the above issues without sacraficing our desktop CSS settings as well. It was a simple, but effective solution to this problem!

All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and modified to meet
assignment requirements. Final implementation reflects my understanding
of the concepts.
