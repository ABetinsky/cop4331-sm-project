## To-Do ASAP

I know some of this stuff may be advanced for this project, but I wanted to write all my ideas down just in case we have time to implement it - Adam

- [ ] Change each field of the home page text boxes to be uppercase on the first letter -> @Frontend Developer
- [ ] For registration and on the contacts page: signify somewhere what a username must include BEFORE a user types it in. Is it case sensitive? Things like that. I think this may include the API -> @DANNYSTARLORD or @noahgerard or @DarrenSquiresJr
- [ ] For email on the signup page: add a visual for the user on signup to check if it's a valid email format (I.E., includes an @ and ends in like .com or something) that responds in real time -> @Frontend Developer
- [ ] Same thing with the password. The user needs to know what kind of password that should be inputted, and real time feedback would be helpful -> @Frontend Developer
- [ ] Finish the about us page -> @bmquin
- [ ] Remove the clock on each page? Feels a bit unnecessary. That way, we can move "COPY" to the middle. If anything, move it to the left of the menu bar or somewhere on the bottom of the page -> @DANNYSTARLORD 
- [ ] Make the page about what COPY is -> @ABetinsky
- [ ] Submit your bio and pictures to the repo for @bmquin to finish the about us page -> @EVERYONE
- [ ] Finish up the router -> @DeliciousBred
- [ ] On the contact page, add a way for the user to logout and/or return back to the home page. If they're logged in and return home, can we add a way to allow the user back into their contacts without writing their credentials again? -> @Frontend Developer and @API Developer
- [ ] On the contact page: change the default placeholder to something a bit more professional -> @Frontend Developer
- [ ] On the contact page: make a consistent format to be inputted for the phone number? Like ensure it's in the (XXX) XXX-XXXX format for example. I think consistency will be key here to what matches in the database -> @Frontend Developer and @API Developer and @Backend Developer
- [ ] On the contact page: Can we add the same type of alerts if a field isn't entered like on the home page? -> @Frontend Developer
- [ ] On the contact page: Could we kind of do a split screen thing where the inputs for each contact are on the left, and the results are on the right? That way, we won't cover up the center of the background -> @Frontend Developer
- [ ] On the contact page: Ensure the partial matching works. For example, if I input "Joh" into the seach bar, should "Banjoh" show up? Or should it just be any contact with a prefix of "Joh" -> @EVERYONE
- [ ] Make sure we all agree on the backgrounds for each page -> @EVERYONE
- [ ] SCHEDULE A COUPLE OF TIMES FOR ALL OF US TO PRACTICE THE PRESENTATION ->  @EVERYONE
- [ ] Finish the README file -> @ABetinsky
- [ ] Add in all AI Disclosures -> @EVERYONE
- [ ] Comment all code files that you wrote -> @EVERYONE
- [ ] Keep building the powerpoint -> @ABetinsky (Primairly), but applied to @Everyone
- [ ] Make Gnatt Chart -> @ABetinsky
- [ ] Test Accessibility and make Lighthouse Report -> @ABetinsky
- [ ] TEST THE SITE ON DIFFERENT DEVICES AND ENSURE IT WORKS -> @Frontend Developer
- [ ] Work on other powerpoint stuff -> @EVERYONE
- [ ] Add in all relevant side items (pictures, drawings, powerpoint, etc) to the repo -> @EVERYONE
- [ ] Add in the disclosure to the images we used that aren't ours -> @EVERYONE
- [ ] TEST EVERYTHING FOR BUGS -> @EVERYONE
