                <strong>O</strong>rganizer for <strong>P</strong>OOSD with
                <strong>Y</strong>adavally. COPY is an implementation of a
                contact manager for POOSD (Processes with Object Oriented
                Software Development) to satisfy the "Small Project" for the
                course with Dr. Yadavally at The University of Central Florida
                (UCF).<br /><br />
                Designed in the early months of 2026, COPY was built by a team
                of 6 undergraduate Computer Science students. COPY is an easy
                way to manage your own personal contact list. COPY supports:

                <li>Deleting existing contacts</li>
                <li>Editing existing contacts</li>
                <li>
                    Searching through contacts (including with partial
                    matching!)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                COPY was developed by a team of 6 undergraduate Computer Science
