Hello! At the time of writing, Andrew is a Junior majoring in Computer Science at The University of Central Florida. He has experience with several programming languages, including Python, C, C#, Javascript, Java, and PHP, with the strongest proficiency in Java. He also has a bit of hands-on experience in project planning and software structuring through various very small personal projects, including mods, plugins, and macros for existing software. For this Contact Manager app, he served as one of the API developers. His main responsibilities focused on designing, building, and documenting the CRUD-based endpoints that handle contact management. He chose this role because he is particularly interested in backend development and has previous experience working with web APIs. He greatly enjoyed working on this project with the rest of the team and hope you enjoy exploring our work!
